# USGS-watlev-to-NAVD88-MLLW-SEP
Use this to analyze United States Geological Survey (USGS) water level data files to calculate average daily minimum water level over the entire time series of available data.
Most (if not all) USGS water level gauges reference water level heights to NAVD88. By calculating average daily minimum water level, you
are essentially calculating the local vertical separation value between mean lower-low water datum (MLLW) and gauge datum (NAVD88). The longer your time series, 
the better it will conform to NOAA CO-OPS standard of a 19 year epoch, encapsulating most major tidal harmonic constituents.
