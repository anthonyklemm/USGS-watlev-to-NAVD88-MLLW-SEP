Use this to analyze USGS water level data files to calculate average daily minimum water level over the entire time sereis of available data.
Most (if not all) USGS water level gauges reference water level heights to NAVD88. By calculating averagea daily minimum water level, you
are essentially calculating the vertical separation value between mean lower-low water datum (MLLW) and gauge datum (NAVD88).
